MINBASE Changelog


Version 0.1.0
22-Mar-2019


+++ New functionality:

+ Added macro MINBASE_API for linkable minbase functionality.

+ Added macros MIN_HAVE_CPLUSPLUS and MIN_HAVE_CPLUSPLUS_11 that are defined
to 1 if the compilation is under c++ and c++11 correspondingly, and to 0
otherwise.

+ Added macro MIN_ALIGNED(N) that is defined to __declspec(align(N)) under MSC
and to __attribute__((aligned(N))) under other compilers.

+ Added header minpreprocessor.h with various generic macros. It replaces old
header macro_helpers.h. New usable macros in preprocessor.h have prefix MIN_PP_, and
internal macros have prefix MIN_PPI_.

+ Add field MinImg *p_landlord to MinImg. It is intended to store info about entity
that owns image memory, which can be that same image (if p_landlord in image
points to the image itself), another MinImg (pointed by p_landlord), or
non-MinImg (if p_landlord is a null-ptr).

+ Added values MINFMT_COUNT and MINTYP_COUNT for enums MinFmt and MinTyp
correspondingly.

+ Added functions MinFormatOfMinType, LogBitSizeOfMinType, ByteSizeOfMinType,
and MinTypeByMinFormatAndLogSize, to get values of MinTyp by MinFmt and
value_size and vice versa.

+ Added header min_pp_mintyp.h with macros to convert (preprocessor-time)
names of ะก/C++ type names to corresponding MinTyp values, MinFmt values,
and logbit sizes, and macros to repeat for all types that have values in
MinTyp some other macro passed as argument.

+ Added placeholder macros to disable gcc warnings in gcc-9.x, without actual
warnings added in this version.

+ Added tests for functionality from mintyp.h, min_pp_mintyp.h, minimg.h.


*** Functionality changes:

* Changed package directory structure: public headers are now in
include/minbase, and include is added to include_directories in cmake for
target minbase and anything that links it via target_link_libraries.

* Changed arguments of macro MIN_PREFETCH: added argument MODE, to control
mode of prefetch.

* Moved macros for warnings suppression to new header warnings.h and
renamed them to MIN_WARNINGS_SUPPRESSION_BEGIN and MIN_WARNINGS_SUPPRESSION_END.

* Moved namespace minstd to new header minstd.hpp.

* Replace fields int32_t channelDepth and MinFmt format in MinImg with single
field MinTyp scalar_type.

* Rename fields addressSpace and pScan0 in MinImg to address_space and
p_zero_line correspondingly.

* Give MinImg it's own name_tag (the same MinImg), beside the typedef.

* Change layout of struct MinImg (address_space is now before p_zero_line).

* Give enums in mintyp.h their own name_tags (same as typedefs), beside the
typedefs.

* Changed definition of real16_t to be declared as struct with that name right
away instead of additional name (real16) used for struct and typedef of that name to
real16_t.
