/**
 * @defgroup MinUtils_MathOper Mathematical operations
 * @brief    The module specifies mathematical operations which can be used in
 *           image processing functions. All operations are specified by the
 *           follow constants: @c #OP_MIN (binary minimum), @c #OP_MAX (binary
 *           maximum), @c #OP_ADD (binary addition), @c #OP_DIF (binary difference),
 *           @c #OP_ADF (binary absolute difference), @c #OP_MUL (binary
 *           multiplication), @c #OP_AVE (binary average), and @c #OP_EUC (binary
 *           Euclidean norm). Additionally, the operations are grouped into several
 *           enums in accordance with their properties: all binary operations
 *           (@c #BiOp), associative operations (@c #AsOp), commutative operations
 *           (@c #CoOp), associative-commutative operations (@c #AsCoOp) and
 *           idempotent operations (@c #IdOp).
